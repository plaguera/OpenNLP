We do not know where this migration had its start; students of the subject believe that it may have begun in the Mississippi Valley near the mouth of the Missouri River. 
We do know, however, that some of their closest relatives settled in northeastern Tennessee; and perhaps, as the ancestral group journeyed up the Tennessee River it split apart at the point of that river's abrupt northward bend in northern Alabama. 
Then a succeeding generation, which took central Georgia for its home, settled in two places near the Ocmulgee River. 
The smaller village was about 5 miles below the present city of Macon on a limestone remnant known as Brown's Mount; the larger, with which we are here concerned, was the "Ocmulgee Old Fields" of the early settlers, across the river from the modern city and adjoining its eastern limit.
The most important feature distinguishing these people from their predecessors, however, was not their town but their very way of life.
They were farmers; besides tobacco, pumpkins, and beans, they cultivated the New World staff of life, corn. 
This way of life enabled them to settle in one place long enough and in sufficient numbers to create a large village, and to develop the religious and ceremonial complex which was expressed in its numerous distinctive structures. 
They built it on the rolling high ground above the river, where their square, thatched houses were scattered among the many buildings connected with their form of worship. 
These latter consisted of rectangular wooden structures which we call temples, and a circular chamber with a wooden framework covered with clay which was a form of earthlodge. 
From our knowledge of the later Indian pattern in this area, we believe that these represented the summer and winter temples, respectively, of the tribe. 

Here the grown men took part in religious ceremonies and held their tribal councils; and here the chief could render decisions in individual disputes, or in matters of importance to the tribe as a whole.
Even at this simple stage of culture, though, there were doubtless well defined rules of conduct. 
All primitive peoples today share certain universals of social life. 
From these we may confidently infer that every man was part of a clearly defined kin group, that the structure and relationships of this group determined into what similar group he might marry, and which were forbidden to him as sources for choosing a mate. 
We can also be reasonably certain that while antisocial acts like murder, adultery, and theft might not be punished by the community at large, strong measures to hold them in check were generally approved even though they might have to be initiated privately. 
In short, the rudiments of social living were already thousands of years old. 
The lives of these early Georgians were different from our own in countless material ways; but even at this early date their primary problems were the same as ours. 
They must have food, shelter, and protection for individual survival; and the continued existence of the group required the education of its younger members in the skills and habits and community organization of their elders. 
The means to these ends were crude, and by our standards extremely simple; but they were not developed without considerable ingenuity; and hard work made up for many technical shortcomings.
Our knowledge starts to increase as we come to the period beginning about 5,000 years ago.
